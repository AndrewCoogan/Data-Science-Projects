# Data-Science-Projects
This will be a hub where I keep data analysis, data science, and machine learning code. About half of this code is EDA, so lots of graphing with Matplotlib and Seaborn.

Text Feedback and Classification - This is a Kaggle project where essays are provided and the objective is to detect which parts of the essary are present (i.e., thesis, defense, conclusion, etc.)

Titanic - This is the very vanilla Titanic data set that everyone starts off with.

Tweet Sentiment and NER - Tweets with a given sentiement are provided and a phrase within that tweet that most contributes to that sentiment. This is a sentiment analysis problem with NER.

UCI Adults - This is a data set provided by UCI. This data set is also basic, similar to Titanic, but a good classification problem. I took this time to work through most of the sklearn off the self models, and some Keras / XGBoost / voting and stacking classifiers a whirl also.
